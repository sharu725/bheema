>"Cinematography: Motion picture photagrhy, litrally 'wrinting in movement'"(Corrian and White, 463)


One of _Be Kind Rewinds_(2008) themes is, Community and people inside the community. This is
shown Though the use of Cinematography in two different ways, The color pallet of the film and the distance of the shots.


Corriagan and white(109) define camera distance as the distance that the subjects are in relation
to the camera. In terms of Be Kind Rewind most of the film is Centered around the characters and local comunity This is shown by the fact that there is only one ariel shot shot (see fig 1) in the entire movie which is The only time that the film shows the wider world which is only used to set location of the film. fig2 and fig3 are some of the examples of how the films Camera puts emphases of the characters and the situations they get into. an exsample of this is fig2 which uses a medium shot Corrian and White(111) define a medium shot as "describes a middle ground in which we see some background detail in the frame. The human body is framed from waist and hips up". In fig2 the viewer sees the three main characters (Jerry, Mike and Mr Fletcher) and some kids in the vhs store. This shot helps to give enough detial of the characters exspesssions and interractions but also give context to where the charcters are in world. Which the location (vhs store) is located inside the comunity (see fig3) showing that this shot is about the people inside the comunity.

>"Color profoundly effects our exsprence of a film shot" Corrigan And White(114)

The color of a shot is often an overlooked becuase of its subtlety but it can have a profound effect on the film with _Be Kind Rewind_ it tends to use more muted colors(see fig1) where the colors are all even and no particular color is highligted above the rest which helps to give a realistic impression to the film. Corrigan and White(471) define Realism as how truthfull a picture is of society, people or any other part of realworld life. What makes This films colors realistic, is that in the real world colors genrally tend to be more even rather one particular color. Which helps the viewer understand that this film is based off the real world and grounds the characters in belibility.

In Contrast in _Fantastic Mr fox_(2009) it tends to use a more styleised approch where it focueses one color for exsample fig4's shot is prodemlty yellow/orange from the background being an orange color to the character and follige having a yellow tint to it as well. This helps the viewer understand that this shot is not tring to be realistic but rather a unrealistic shot thats tring to imitate a world not based in reality.

To Conclude though the use of camera distance It can help to emphsize the characters actions and color can be used to ground the world films in a imitation of reality
